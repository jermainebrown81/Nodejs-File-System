we need to get the unique input from the user and store this information ?

when someone adds a new note we want to save it somewhere i.e file system this is where
json comes in.


json (javascript object notation) represents javascript arrays and objects using a string.

why would we want to use this ?

Ans: we can save json as it is a string to i.e a text file , database then read it later
and parse it back into javascript array or object and do something with it.
